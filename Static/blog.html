<p class="simple"> March 30, 2018 <br/><img src="baby.jpg"> <br/><br/><br/>We went to the beach last Holy Week and I brought Miguel with me. I'm so glad my parents allowed him to come with us. The surprising thing is it was not our idea. It was my siblings' request. He really won my family over. Except of course for the few titos and titas. I'm glad dad doesn't disllike him, though I'm not saying he likes him either. The experience was new and it felt nice. Darn it. I fell hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
